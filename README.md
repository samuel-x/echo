## How to build
0. Ensure [Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio/) are installed on your computer.
1. Navigate to a directory where you would like to put the project.
2. Open a terminal and type in "git clone https://github.com/COMP30022-18/DropTable_Server/"
    - Git should clone the repository into its own folder.
3. Open up Android Studio.
4. There is a folder called "Echo" inside the repository you've downloaded. Open it in Android Studio as a project.
5. Set up an Android emulator if you have not already. Otherwise, [follow these instructions](https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator).
6. Run with the emulator within Android Studio. The instructions linked in the previous step also explain this.
